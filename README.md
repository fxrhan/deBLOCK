**What it does**

DataCV is a decentralised application that stores data and is based on interplanetary file system(IPFS). It is storage application which comes with top cream privileges. The user can upload any format of data and adhere to their account only. They can access easily anytime and anywhere around the universe when they have one of the node along with them. It is authenticated by containerised app-write.

Features we provide:

- The users can upload single or multiple files at single time to their choice of format. As DataCV supports the formats of image, video, music, files like pdf, docx, apk, etc.
- Only particular user is authorised to access their data and adhere to the environment of IPFS protocol with transport encryption.
- Every time potential user after login can access the previous history of all uploads with perks of acknowledgment.

**Problem it solves:**

In a minute, hundred and thousands of data from the centralised server get exposed to public and decentralised application relies on peer to peer(P2P) network which overcomes the drawback of centralised servers by fulfilling the availability and compatibility of the system with more secure manner. 

Hence, dataCV reflects the solution in following ways:

- Only potential user can access their unique details of past records easily.
- Even people with less hands on software application can easily interact with dataCV and enjoys the perk of decentralised storage.
- The privacy and confidentiality of users and their data is maintained.

**Challenges we ran into:**

- It was quite tough to save user data in format of array of objects in app-write database.
- It was challenging task to connect with the IPFS protocol to store files in this network.

**What we learnt:**

- We gained the knowledge on IPFS protocol and its working.
- We gained the insights on how to foster decentralised application on top of IPFS protocol.
- We learnt how to integrate containerised docker for authentication.
- We learnt how to interpret with app-write for backend service and database.

**Technologies used:**

The following technologies are used for making this storage DApp on IPFS protocol:

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, App-write, NFTStorage SDK, Github
